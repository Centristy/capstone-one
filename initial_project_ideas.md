In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!


# 1. Travel Bucket (node.js react)

Create a website that users will log into, create a travel bucket lists. They can blog about their travels, and those blogs will be updates into a list based on travel location. Users can be ranked based on how many places they've travled too, example 1-5 locations travel amateur and 250+ Nomad. Ill use a Geolocation API in my coding.

Check API call *


#2. Sports Prediction Website

Using Bayesian data analysis, I'll create a website that evaluates sporting event outcomes either for Soccer or American Football. Since it'll evaluate player stats. I'll use a Sports API to fill in teams and players. Users will also be able to fill in polls with their predictions and have an accuracy score attributed to their user name

#3. Language Learning Website

Users will be able to create flash cards from different languages and run through them to learn the language of their choice. I'll use a language API to prepopulate some more useful words into remade categories. For this I'll use a Language able to fill in the premade cards. Each card should be able to hold an original language - new language and a picture of the item.

	Expand authentication
	Use a Database Table
