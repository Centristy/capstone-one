### Goal : Create a user friendly app that can help students learn a new language. For the interest of time, I will make this specifically targeting English speakers trying to learn Korean



### The goal of this app:

1. Users should be able to create flash cards stacks and run through them.

2. Users will have a rubric and can turn flash cards into a test

3. Flash cards will be easy to use / change / create / delete

4. Users can make their flash cards available for public / private use

5. Users should be able to make their own profiles.


### Priority

1. User friendly / Easy to sign in / Browse / Edit

2. Handle storage / presentation / display of global resources

### Stretch Goals

1. Auto translation predictions to allow users faster flash card creation


### Demographic
